## Bio

I am a Security Researcher at [sec3](https://www.sec3.dev/), where I focus on conducting in-depth security research in the realms of Solana, Move, and Rust.

My research interest spans broadly in computer security, including program analysis, AI security and Web3 Security.

Iâ€™ve participated in a lot of CTF competitions. I am currently a member of [Nu1L Team](https://www.nu1l.com/) and [Straw Hat](https://strawhat.team/). I mainly solve Crypto and AI challenges in CTFs, I also developed a great interest in reverse engineering.

I obtained my M.E. degree in Computer Science from [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn), advised by [Prof. Fu Song](http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/songfu/).
