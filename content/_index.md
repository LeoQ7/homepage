## Bio

I am a third-year Computer Science Master student in [System and Software Security Lab](https://s3l.shanghaitech.edu.cn/) at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Fu Song](http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/songfu/). In the meanwhile, I am a visiting scholar in the Department of Computer Science at Northwestern University, under the supervision of [Prof. Xinyu Xing](http://xinyuxing.org/).

My research interest spans broadly in computer security, including program analysis, AI security and Web3 Security.

Iâ€™ve participated in a lot of CTF competitions. I am currently a member of [Nu1L Team](https://www.nu1l.com/) and [Straw Hat](https://strawhat.team/). I mainly solve Crypto and AI challenges in CTFs, I also developed a great interest in reverse engineering.

I obtained my B.E. degree in Computer Science from [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn) in July 2020.
