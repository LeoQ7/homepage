In addition to the traditional Solidity challenges, Mysten Labs and OtterSec provided four Sui Move challenges as a separate category. Fortunately, I managed to get two first bloods and two second bloods, placing me first in this specific track. Apart from these four challenges, there was also an intriguing challenge involving Move bytecode reverse engineering. Since I have previously written several related writeups, I won’t delve into it here. Interested readers can refer to the excellent writeups by ashleyhsu.eth and jinu.eth.

Similarly, we can derive the recipe for the second one. Using the ChefCapability permission to “create” the individual components of the hamburgers, we can represent both hamburgers using two wrapper structs and then proceed with the delivery of the orders. modulesolution::mc_chicken_solution{// [*] Import dependencies usesui::tx_context::TxContext;usechallenge::mc_chicken;struct Order1Burgerhasstore,drop{bun: mc_chicken::Bun,mayo: mc_chicken::Mayo,lettuce: mc_chicken::Lettuce,chicken_schnitzel: mc_chicken::ChickenSchnitzel,cheese: mc_chicken::Cheese,bun2: mc_chicken::Bun,}struct Order2Burgerhasstore,drop{bun: mc_chicken::Bun,cheese: mc_chicken::Cheese,cheese2: mc_chicken::Cheese,chicken_schnitzel: mc_chicken::ChickenSchnitzel,cheese3: mc_chicken::Cheese,chicken_schnitzel2: mc_chicken::ChickenSchnitzel,cheese4: mc_chicken::Cheese,chicken_schnitzel3: mc_chicken::ChickenSchnitzel,cheese5: mc_chicken::Cheese,cheese6: mc_chicken::Cheese,bun2: mc_chicken::Bun,}// [*] Public functions publicfunsolve(chef: \u0026mutmc_chicken::ChefCapability,order1: \u0026mutmc_chicken::Order,order2: \u0026mutmc_chicken::Order,ctx: \u0026mutTxContext){letburger1=Order1Burger{bun: mc_chicken::get_bun(chef),mayo: mc_chicken::get_mayo(chef),lettuce: mc_chicken::get_lettuce(chef),chicken_schnitzel: mc_chicken::get_chicken_schnitzel(chef),cheese: mc_chicken::get_cheese(chef),bun2: mc_chicken::get_bun(chef),};mc_chicken::deliver_order(chef,order1,burger1,ctx);letburger2=Order2Burger{bun: mc_chicken::get_bun(chef),cheese: mc_chicken::get_cheese(chef),cheese2: mc_chicken::get_cheese(chef),chicken_schnitzel: mc_chicken::get_chicken_schnitzel(chef),cheese3: mc_chicken::get_cheese(chef),chicken_schnitzel2: mc_chicken::get_chicken_schnitzel(chef),cheese4: mc_chicken::get_cheese(chef),chicken_schnitzel3: mc_chicken::get_chicken_schnitzel(chef),cheese5: mc_chicken::get_cheese(chef),cheese6: mc_chicken::get_cheese(chef),bun2: mc_chicken::get_bun(chef),};mc_chicken::deliver_order(chef,order2,burger2,ctx);}} ","date":"2023-09-19","objectID":"/2023/09/MetaTrust-CTF-Sui/:4:2","tags":["Web3","CTF","Move"],"title":"2023 MetaTrust Web3 Security CTF Sui Challenges Writeup","uri":"/2023/09/MetaTrust-CTF-Sui/"},{"categories":["Web3"],"content":"Challenge 4: Coin Flip Challenge Info It’s all about luck … they say … Host: metatrustctf.sui.io Port: 31340 Source: https://github.com/MetaTrustLabs/ctf/tree/master/coinFlip Score: 200 ","date":"2023-09-19","objectID":"/2023/09/MetaTrust-CTF-Sui/:5:0","tags":["Web3","CTF","Move"],"title":"2023 MetaTrust Web3 Security CTF Sui Challenges Writeup","uri":"/2023/09/MetaTrust-CTF-Sui/"},{"categories":["Web3"],"content":"Target contract In this challenge, the author has created a coin flipping game that requires users to consecutively guess correctly 12 times in a row.

The answer is yes. Although Move language restricts us from accessing struct’s fields defined in the Foo module within the Bar module under normal circumstances, there’s a clever workaround, which involves using the BCS encoding. /* https://github.com/MetaTrustLabs/ctf/blob/master/coinFlip/framework/chall/sources/coin_flip.move#L22-L35 */struct Randomhasdrop,store,copy{seed: u64 }struct Gamehaskey,store{id: UID,stake: Coin\u003cSUI\u003e,combo: u8,fee: u8,player: address,author: address,randomness: Random,solved: bool,} Recalling what we mentioned earlier, BCS encoding only serializes and concatenates the underlying types within a struct. In the case of the Game, after serializing it, if we read the ninth-to-last byte (skipping the 1 byte for solved and the 7 high-order bytes for seed), we will obtain the least significant byte of game.randomness.seed. Once we have this seed, we can use the same LCG as in the challenge to generate random numbers and predict the outcomes, achieving a 100% correct guessing rate. modulesolution::coin_flip_solution{// [*] Import dependencies usesui::tx_context::TxContext;usechallenge::coin_flip;usesui::coin::{Self,Coin};usesui::sui::SUI;usestd::bcs;usestd::vector;struct Randomhasdrop,store,copy{seed: u64 }// [*] Public functions publicentryfunsolve(game: \u0026mutcoin_flip::Game,balance: Coin\u003cSUI\u003e,ctx: \u0026mutTxContext){letbytes: vector\u003cu8\u003e=bcs::to_bytes(game);letsecret=*vector::borrow(\u0026bytes,vector::length(\u0026bytes)-9);letr=new_generator((secretasu64));letround=0;letfee=coin::split(\u0026mutbalance,10,ctx);coin_flip::start_game(game,fee,ctx);while(round\u003c11){letguess=generate_rand(\u0026mutr)%2;round=round+1;coin_flip::play_game(game,(guessasu8),coin::split(\u0026mutbalance,10,ctx),ctx);};letguess=generate_rand(\u0026mutr)%2;coin_flip::play_game(game,(guessasu8),balance,ctx);}funnew_generator(seed: u64): Random{Random{seed}}fungenerate_rand(r: \u0026mutRandom): u64 {r.seed=((((9223372036854775783u128*((r.seedasu128))+999983)\u003e\u003e1)\u00260x0000000000000000ffffffffffffffff)asu64);r.seed}} ","date":"2023-09-19","objectID":"/2023/09/MetaTrust-CTF-Sui/:5:2","tags":["Web3","CTF","Move"],"title":"2023 MetaTrust Web3 Security CTF Sui Challenges Writeup","uri":"/2023/09/MetaTrust-CTF-Sui/"},{"categories":["Web3"],"content":"Writeup for the reverse challenge - Move VM in pbctf 2023","date":"2023-02-19","objectID":"/2023/02/PBCTF-Move-VM/","tags":["Web3","CTF","Move"],"title":"PBCTF 2023 Move VM Writeup","uri":"/2023/02/PBCTF-Move-VM/"},{"categories":["Web3"],"content":"Preface This weekend, I participated in the pbctf 2023 and got the first blood for the reverse challenge Move VM.

The contract has five functions: init_challenge, hash, discrete_log, add, pow and get_flag. The init_challenge function is used to initialize the challenge by sending the caller a Challenge object with 5 members, balance=10, q1=false, q2=false, q3=false, and an event handler. q1, q2, q3 indicates the solving status of the 3 sub-problems in this challenge, and these status will be checked in the get_flag function. q1: hash q1 will be set to true if we invoke the hash function and provide a guess: vector\u003cu8\u003e satisfying len(guess)==4 \u0026\u0026 keccak256(guess+\"move\")==\"d9ad5396ce1ed307e8fb2a90de7fd01d888c02950ef6852fbc2191d2baf58e79\". This can be solved by writing a simple script to brute-force all the possible guesses, and the answer is good. q2: discrete_log In order to set q2 to true, we need to provide a guess: u128 satisfying pow(10549609011087404693, guess, 18446744073709551616) == 18164541542389285005, which is a classic discrete logarithm problem. We can solve this with discrete_log(18164541542389285005,Mod(10549609011087404693,18446744073709551616)) in sage, and the answer is $3123592912467026955$. q3: add The sub-problem q3 is more interesting. Similar to other checked arithmetic implementation, the Shl and Shr operations in Move language will raise an ARITHMETIC_ERROR if the shift amount is greater than or equal to the bit width of the operand as this is a cpu-level undefined behavior. And the Shl operations won’t raise ARITHMETIC_ERROR if there is an overflow. So we can shift the current balance $10$ to the left by more than $8$ bits to set the balance to $0$.

Most defense methods aim to build robust model in the closed set (e.g., under fixed datasets with constrained perturbation types and budgets). However, in the real-world scenario, adversaries would bring more harms and challenges to the deep learning-based applications by generating unrestricted attacks, such as large and visible noises, perturbed images with unseen labels, etc. To accelerate the research on building robust models in the open set, we organize this challenge track. Participants are encouraged to develop a robust detector that could distinguish clean examples from perturbed ones on unseen noises and classes by training on a limited-scale dataset. In essence, it’s an adversarial example detection competition that requires participants to determine whether a input image is a benign sample or an adversarial example. In this area, our research center (SSC) has published two related papers [1][2], both of which use the similar idea that different kinds of adversarial samples will have unique characteristics. In [1], the authors proposed Magnet, which use an autoencoder to learn the manifold of normal examples. MagNet reconstructs adversarial examples by moving them towards the manifold. Therefore, adversarial examples with large perturbation could be detected directly based on the reconstruction error. If the input has a small perturbation, the noise can be eliminated and changed to a benign sample after decoding. In [2], robustness is used to filter out those samples that just cross the decision boundary, followed by other methods to filter out those large perturbation samples. We adopted a similar strategy in the final round.

Initially, our conjecture was that due to the compression algorithm of PNG, the adversarial perturbation corrupts the locality smoothness of the pixels to some extent, which subsequently affects the effectiveness of PNG compression. However, after deeper analysis we found that the organizers introduced a huge information leak when saving the images: although all images have the suffix of .png, only the file type of the adversarial samples is actually PNG, and the actual file type of most images is JPEG, which are almost all benign samples. ❯ exa | wc -l 5000 ❯ file *.png | grep JPEG | wc -l 4627 ❯ file 0.png 0.png: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, aspect ratio, density 1x1, segment length 16, baseline, precision 8, 224x224, components 3 ❯ file 35.png 35.png: PNG image data, 224 x 224, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced By leveraging this information leakage, we achieved nearly 100% accuracy and became the top qualifier.

Therefore, we chose to use the strategy similar to the previous two papers where we first classify the potential adversarial examples and use different detection methods for different types of adversarial examples. We divided the adversarial examples into four categories, namely Adversarial Patch [3], Square Attack [4], Universial Adversial Patch (UAP) [5] or Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) [6], and others. We locally constructed a dataset of about 2,000 adversarial examples and 18,000 benign samples, which consists of about 250 images of Patch, 250 images of Square, 500 UAP or FGSM images and the other 1,000 images generated by adversarial attacks that seek to minimize the $L_2$ perturbations. For Patch samples, we trained a autoencoder and used the reconstruction error of $L_{inf}$ distance as a judgment metric. As the patch adversarial examples have a significant noise in a region about 20*20, the reconstruction error tends to be close to 1 for that type of adversarial examples, while the reconstruction error for benign samples is closer to 0.            For Square samples, a distinctive feature is the presence of some colored vertical stripes and rectangles visible to the naked eye on the picture. And we noted that the H channel has significant vertical stripes after converting the color space to HSV space. Therefore, we further calculated the difference of the sum of each column. The larger the difference indicates that the corresponding image is more likely to be a Square sample.            For UAP and FGSM samples, they are characterized by the presence of some noise or continuous texture on the image. To make these features more prominent, we used a Laplacian operator to enhance the edges and subsequently enhance the effect of the noise. Similar to square samples, we observed that the noise in the V channel is more pronounced after transforming the images onto HSV space. To measure the amount of noise, we computed histograms for the V channel. The more the curve on the histograms plot is skewed in the positive direction of the x-axis, the more noisy the image is, and the more likely it is a UAP or FGSM sample. Therefore, we constructed an expression to determine the shape of the histogram curve and subsequently whether the image is an adversarial sample.           For other samples, we directly utilize the metrics used for square detection as the organizer will find out the best threshold that yields the highest F1-Score, rather than requiring us to make a binary classification. Our intention was to use the model output or sample robustness to make judgments, just as [2], but unfortunately the organizers of this competition did not provide model information, so these adversarial examples may have poor transferability against our locally trained model.           Distance to decision boundary of a blue normal example and brown adversarial example.
