Here is a brief writeup for this challenge.
Challenge Info Challenge Info Attachment: message.mv Solves: 6 Score: 383 In this challenge, we are given a message.mv file, which is a serialized Move module. As this is a reverse challenge, we need to reverse the module, analyze the algorithm that checks the flag and finally calculate the flag.</description></item><item><title>CTF MOVEment with Aptos Dec 2022 Writeup</title><link>https://leoq7.com/2022/12/CTF-Movement-Aptos/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 17:55:28 +0800</pubDate><author>Qi Qin</author><guid>https://leoq7.com/2022/12/CTF-Movement-Aptos/</guid><description>Preface It&amp;rsquo;s been half a year since I last wrote a blog. During that time, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot about Web3 security, including Solana and Aptos. Last weekend, I participated in the CTF MOVEment with Aptos Dec 2022 jointly organized by MoveBit, Aptos, ChainFlag and OtterSec, and scored two first-bloods and two second-bloods in the four challenges except the sanity-check, ranking first in the end. In this post, I will briefly introduce the solutions to the five challenges.</description></item><item><title>CTF MOVEment with Aptos Dec 2022 Writeup</title><link>https://leoq7.com/2022/12/MetaTrust-CTF-Sui/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 17:55:28 +0800</pubDate><author>Qi Qin</author><guid>https://leoq7.com/2022/12/MetaTrust-CTF-Sui/</guid><description>Preface Last week, I participated solo in the 2023 MetaTrust Web3 Security CTF. In addition to the traditional Solidity challenges, Mysten Labs and OtterSec provided four Sui Move challenges as a seperate catrgory. Fortunately, I managed to get two first bloods and two second bloods, placing me first in this specific track. Apart from these four challenges, there was also an intriguing challenge involving Move bytecode reverse engineering. Since I have previously written several related writeups, I won&amp;rsquo;t delve into it here.</description></item></channel></rss>
