During that time, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot about Web3 security, including Solana and Aptos. Before learning Solana and Aptos, I had some exposure to Ethereum during my freshman year. In my opinion, Solana and Aptos not only have a significant improvement in TPS over Ethereum, but the contracts written in Rust and Move are more secure; in terms of user-friendliness, the Move language is easier to use and less error-prone than Rust and Anchor.</description></item></channel></rss>
