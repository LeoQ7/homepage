The tasks were divided into three categories: 3 easy challenges worth 100 points, 3 medium challenges worth 200 points, and 2 difficult ones valued at 300 points.
What made this CTF unique was that all the challenges were written in Tact, a high-level language designed for the TON ecosystem.</description></item></channel></rss>
